I'm going to give up on properly setting up racket to handle categories

Instead, I'll have a python script generate a tag-page in tags/ , to be served statically.
Tag links will simply link to tags/tag.html

We'll render each pollen file, using `raco pollen render inputfile outputfile`, dropping it into the html/ dir
then we'll scan the html with python, finding "titles" and "tags"
and generate a page for each tag, using jinja for templating
html/tags/ will store all the tag pages
the html/ dir gets scp'd to nearlyfreespeech webserver
And the whole thing exists there statically.

** How to represent the tag-list? ** 
List of headers, linked to page
    Render, get <span id="title"> title </title>
Header w/ first paragraph ala http://mstill.io/blog/category/programming.html
    Render first, then find anything in <span id="tag"> blocks
    then get the first <p> </p> block, and thats our first paragraph
