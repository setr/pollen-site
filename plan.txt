◊filen{ } 
  for displaying filenames

◊snip{ }
  for displaying code example snippets (but not full code)
  basically, inlining code.

◊key{ }
  for displaying keywords, but with only minor change.
  ie for ◊|variable| => ◊|META|◊key{variable}

◊polyc{ }
  for displaying pollen commands
  NEED TO FIGURE OUT NESTING
  color it maroon

◊code{ }
  needs to strip the first break, because I want to write it in markdown as
  ◊code{
  ... ... 
  ... ...}

◊pollen-ex{ }
  need to figure out a formatting for ◊|variable| ◊(function) ◊tag{variable} stuff
  maybe just ◊ gets colored (redefine META)

Add lines for headers
