In light of how pervasive erotic animations is in contemporary Japan, we can only wonder at the speed and urgency with which it made its way into the core of its pop culture. Although Japan did not shy away from graphic representations of sexuality, notably during the Edo period, much changed after the country opened itself to the West, bringing with it an entirely new set of moral codes and precepts. (And this was only exacerbated during the post-war American occupation of the country.) While undercover publications of ‘naughty’ drawings and pictures circulated discreetly, Tezuka Osamu was perhaps unknowingly opening Pandora’s box with his curvaceous young women who never seemed to grow out of adolescence. Later on, Tezuka would be the first mainstream manga and anime artist to introduce sex in his work, producing Senya Ichiya Monogatari (One Thousand and One Nights, 1969), and directing Cleopatra (1970).
The Sixties saw the launch of a new manga aesthetic in the pages of Garo and Com, while the Seventies introduced key figures who radicalized the use of eroticism in manga, such as Nagai Go, who would go on to create Cutey Honey in 1973, and hentai (pornographic) godfather Ishii Takashi, who appeared in 1971, whose depictions of sexuality were far more adult oriented. This ‘independence’ of style motivated a group of artists and supporters to establish the first Comic Market, in 1975, as a way to promote new fanzines, new artists and new writers, and introduced several creators of popular boy-love series.
